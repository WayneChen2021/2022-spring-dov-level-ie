(reporter) (words indistinct) commander, when do you expect the fmln to join the process? (handal) look, deadlines are not the most important thing right now. what is important now is complying with the agreements to reach political agreements. that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement. it is possible that some deadlines will not be met. if deadlines are set and the time for implementing them expires, then this is tantamount to wasting time. this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadlines for reaching them. therefore, according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas, the accent is on the political agreements. those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces. everything related to the armed forces must be changed. every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective. changes are necessary; changes must be made and those changes must be significant. these changes must completely transform the armed forces, beginning with its role and influence in determining the country's policies and guidelines. we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time. the topic of democratization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces, to its purging, its reduction, and in sum, its end. we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces. as with any institution or historical factor, it emerges, it is maintained for a certain time, and then it tends to disappear. the country must have the opportunity to develop. it can not continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country. for several decades, the armed forces have meant absence of liberty, real security, and the impossibility of the civilian society to decide the country's path. elections have been turned into a mere formality, where those who were not elected run the country. the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public, the murder of the jesuit priests. everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished. we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvadoran people's history in the current century.

after 50 days as president. he notes that since he assumed power on 1 june, the farabundo marti national liberation front has increased its level of violence and its number of \"indiscriminate killings.\" he says that there is no reason for this since he expressed on 1 june his desire find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the country. cristiani says that since 1 june he has repeatedly called for a peace dialogue, adding: \"in order to begin a dialogue of this nature, it must be held in two phases: naturally, during the first phase both sides must sit down to discuss the mechanisms to develop that dialogue process, a timetable for the talks, and the place where the talks will be held. in other words, the first phase will be to determine how the dialogue process will take place. the second phase--once an agreement is reached on how the dialogue will be held--is what will be discussed. in that regard, our government has not set any conditions. we are willing to discuss any topic, because we know that we must find solutions to many things, and we are willing to do so. the only condition we have demanded for this dialogue process is that, once it begins, it should not be interrupted for any reason. we believe that people want peace as soon as possible, and we can not hold talks for years. once we sit down to talk, that dialogue should continue until an overall solution is found to the conflict. that is our government's position, and we maintain that position because we believe it is the most logical one.\" turning to economic matters, cristiani says that the country needs to solve three problems: the fiscal deficit, inflation, and unemployment. he says that as a first step to begin the national economic recovery is to reform the government's pricing policy, adding: \"we must protect low-income groups, and for this reason we have asked the economy minister to begin a process aimed at eliminating price controls. we believe that we can eliminate price controls on 230 products without having a major impact on the majority of the public and that we can keep staple products under the control of the economy ministry.\" he says that price controls on staples like basic grains, powdered milk, flour, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil and lard, cement for housing, and oil by-products will not be eliminated. regarding the transportation sector, cristiani says: \"we agreed with the transportation sector to deregulate the differential service. to allow them to continue serving low-income segments of the population while charging current fares, we will also allow them to offer the higher-priced service. in other words, people will be able to choose what kind of service they want to use: whether they continue to use the low-priced service or a better, more comfortable, and faster service.\" on electricity rates, cristiani says: \"we feel that adjustments to electricity rates should be applied as a result of power that is wasted, that is, because it is power that is being consumed beyond what is needed to live normally. the increase in electricity rates will be directly proportional to the consumption of energy in each home. we believe that with this initial measure, the cel (lempa river hydroelectric executive commission) solve problems.\" turning to other economic measures, cristiani says: \"we have to take short-term measures too. in this respect, the most logical step is to take measures that will affect consumption and not revenues. thus, we have asked the finance minister to take measures related to taxes. he is to consolidate tax payments and only exempt the previously mentioned basic bread basket items from the present 5-percent tax. we have to start eliminating tax exemptions. only exports should have some type of monetary incentive because our country is interested in developing its exports. the rest of the country's economic sectors should be taxed at the same rate.\" cristiani adds: \"we are going to modify the system of paying income tax. we believe that the current system is based on unjust regulations, on revenues earned the previous year that do not reflect a firm's present situation. thus, we are going to request that income-tax payments be based on a small percentage of the firm's present sales; these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\" cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development. he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country. regarding the country's currency, cristiani says: \"we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange. we do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon. everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 (colones) to 1 (dollar), the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\" further details as available.", "pred_templates": [], "gold_templates": []}, "TST3-MUC4-0026": {"doctext": "1. during the years of dictatorship, chilean foreign relations were divided into two processes. on the one hand, as the dictatorship became more and more isolated, it was increasingly condemned in international fora and repudiated by international public opinion. on the other hand, as more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a free chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause, our organizations and democratic parties became increasingly open to the world. thus, they expanded their horizons and contributed their experiences. 2. during this period, the party has substantially strengthened its international relations and enhanced its vision of the international situation. it has strengthened its ties with the latin american peoples' revolutionary and democratic cause, and it has fully immersed itself in the great debates of world socialism. to these debates we brought our views on a profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy, development, and social change. 3. our relations with the parties that make up the international socialist (si) and with the si organization itself have been enriched within this context. this strengthening of ties has been the result of two things. first, it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles the si has upheld regarding the chilean situation. in october 1973, a few days after the coup, si chairman willy brandt condemned the end of the chilean democracy and president allende's assassination at the un general assembly. at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means. since then, the si has been permanently mobilized in favor of chile by making the chilean cause and salvador allende the symbols of all international struggle for democracy and change. it is within this framework of interest and cooperation that the voice of chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas and proposals praised. 4. the second reason stems from the process of expansion and transformation experienced by the si in the past 2 decades. the overall process of change that took place in the world during this period--the technological revolution, the growing interdependence among nations, expansion of communications, global nuclear and military proliferation, the emergence of developing countries as international counterparts, the worsening of extreme poverty and international inequalities, the progress of liberation struggles in the third world, international awareness of the values of democracy and human rights--has also effected major changes in the ideas and positions of socialist parties around the world. in this framework, the si has expanded its outlook, has increasingly renewed its ideas and, above all, has accepted pluralism within its fold as well as a broad internal debate about the best way to promote the cause of an autonomous, democratic socialism. it should be noted that this debate acquired a democratic, antifascist content

organizations there are actively trying to achieve political goals through terrorist activity. hadashot has learned from a source who was in peru for about 6 months that elements linked to the drug growers spent approximately$ 9 million on military equipment from israeli arms dealers in 1987. the equipment included galil rifles, flak jackets, ammunition belts and ammunition, various types of grenades, and communications and night vision equipment. in 1988 and 1989, in additional deals worth some$ 6 million, mortars, shells, sniper rifles, and ammunition for light weapons were purchased. the arms were sent to peru via mexico and guatemala. at least 3 idf (israel defense forces) reserve officers were in peru for over 2 months in early 1988 to organize fighting units. the peruvian fighters were presented to the officers as belonging to right-wing political bodies in the country, and the team of instructors included mercenaries from the netherlands and england. the team of instructors was made up of some 10 people, some of whom were recruited through an israeli-netherlander arms dealer who lives in amsterdam. the netherlands media is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into the subject despite the surprising lack of interest by the netherlands authorities in the affair. at the same time, israelis in neighboring bolivia acted as instructors in a course on safeguarding businessmen, guerrilla warfare, and regional defense. these israelis reached bolivia in the wake of an arms consignment worth some$ 12 million, which arrived in peru (country as published) via a third party, which purchased it in an african country, which in turn had received it from israel. following the reports on deals by israelis abroad, the income tax investigations division has begun an inquiry into tax payments on israeli arms deals and training abroad. in the past 5 years, the scope of commissions paid to arms dealers is estimated at$ 1 billion. at least half of it went to big dealers, such as sha'ul eisenberg, marcus katz, pesah ben-or, israces, and others. they are not under suspicion of trying to cheat or hide information from the tax authorities.",

combining of the campaign with the just economic, political, and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship. these demands are related to the struggle against repression, the defense of human rights, the denunciation of crimes committed by the regime, and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture, disappearances, and assassinations. these questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many rightist candidates are demagogically attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since el mercurio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the cni (national information center) into an agency of the army so that the main repressive body from all these years can be under his direct control. jaime inzunza, leader of the united left and the communist party of chile, discusses these topics over a direct phone line from santiago, chile. (begin recording) (announcer) how are the chilean people's demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign? (inzunza) they are connected through the democratization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers; the development of the committees for victory, which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the democratic task; the development of confidence; the struggle for human rights, particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners; and naturally for the dissolution of the cni. all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign, and agreements have been reached within social organizations. this was evidenced a week ago by the salvadora strike and by the current strike by coal miners. this proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle. (end recording) the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader jaime inzunza, who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program \"escucha chile.\" another topic discussed by inzunza was the el mercurio report on the cni's transfer to the army. the dissolution of the cni has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of chileans. (begin recording) (announcer) what is your opinion, jaime inzunza, on the dictator's intention to maintain the cni as it is and to keep it under his direct command? (inzunza) i believe that this issue is particularly serious. the intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship, which has been responsible for the most flagrant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence. i understand that the dina (national intelligence directorate, replaced by cni) and the cni have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state terrorrism over the past 15 years. if transferred to the army, the cni would continue to be under pinochet's orders. under whose orders has it been all these years? for whom has it been a direct agent all these years? henceforth it will be under the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army. (end recording) communist leader jaime inzunza added that pinochet's intent in transferring the cni to the army's direct command is to make the institution an accomplice in concealing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations. (begin recording) (inzunza) the idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not responsible. this is clear: what the democratic opposition forces want is to have the culprits behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted, not the military institution. the transfer of the cni to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as accomplices or accessories to those crimes. loyalty is not at stake here; loyalty is defending values and principles, not some sort of criminal complicity that is not in line with the training of these men. this seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the cni under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years, the dictator himself.

with an automatic ak-47 rifle, amilcar said that the fmln \"has consolidated the zacamil, cuscatancingo, mejicanos, and panama neighborhoods, and we have besieged the 1st infantry brigade.\" all the

international airport, the main airport of the country, we have succeeded in letting the world that we are at war and are an emerging power,\" the rebel commander said. comalapa airport, located 50 km

december municipal elections and protect the citizens' right to vote. a few minutes before the release of this decree to the press, police patrols raided the centers where the hunger strikes were taking place. police used excessive force in these raids. the 250 strikers arrested in la paz were taken in trucks and buses of the police, the air force, and other state institutions, to the el elto

(hurtado) mr president, following the tela and costa del sol meetings, nicaragua has changed its stand. in costa rica, president ortega was asked if he had sold out the fmln in exchange for the demobilization of the contras and other results of the summit in favor of nicaragua. i would like to know your opinion about this, and also how you interpret the fact that president ortega has accepted some issues about the fmln that he did not allow in tela or costa del sol? on the other hand, will the demobilization of the fmln be the result of a dialogue or negotiations later on? (cristiani) in the first place, i believe that daniel ortega was unable to pull any more tricks out of his hat, and he was facing a fact he could no longer hide: he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in central america and trying to hamper democratic processes in the region. once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in tela, but rather violating these commitments. on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense. therefore, in our opinion, he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in central america, or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support. this situation would cause him many problems and headaches in political and diplomatic matters.", "pred_templates": [], "gold_templates": []}, "TST3-MUC4-0076": {"doctext": "comrades: a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central american presidents' emergency meeting. let us see first why the meeting took place. the main reason is the very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed cristiani and the high command. as you will remember, the government has met with much international disrepute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population. let us recall, as a significant fact, that the united nations has condemned the government because of all it has done, especially because of the latest atrocities. on that occasion, el salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor. we mention this case as a most significant one, but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation. this was a cause of concern for the north americans. to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on cristiani? the north americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the genocidal regime and that, on the contrary, would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed. the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central american presidents, because in central america, as we all know, the north americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests. the meeting was called to try to pull cristiani out of international isolation. under what conditions did summit take place? we have to say first that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica, and probably of guatemala, had reached an agreement prior to the meeting. the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and cerezo. this document expressed support for cristiani from the very beginning. joseph sullivan, a u.s. state department official in charge of latin american affairs, as well as other u.s. state department officials, were present at the meeting. the costa rican ambassador to nicaragua--a pro-u.s. man who introduced the nicaraguan contras at the meeting--was also present, conspiring all the time. the fmln was not even allowed to enter costa rica. however, in spite of the fact that the meeting had been fixed and in spite of the u.s. presence, the agreement to support cristiani was achieved almost at the price of killing the esquipulas agreement. it was not easy. the u.s. will to condemn the fmln and to back cristiani prevailed in the midst of much bickering and the insolence of the honduran president. as you can see, it was not easy to find support for the genocidal regime even in places where the north americans think they have the bull by the horns. let us see, as a third point, in what the declaration consists.

through the panamanian charge d'affaires in lima, our surprise and strong protest over that decision. 3. in view of this decision, the peruvian government has decided to reduce the personnel of its diplomatic mission in panama and to maintain its relations with that country at the first secretary level. peru will in this way continue to fulfill the humanitarian mission of protecting those who have sought asylum in its embassy in panama while the panamanian government issues the safe-conducts that we requested in accordance to the convention on diplomatic asylum signed in caracas on 28 march 1954. peru is contacting the members of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement (group of eight) to explain the situation and to ask for solidarity and cooperation in overcoming this momentary crisis. the delicate situation regarding the people at the peruvian embassy has provoked our justified alarm and impelled us to begin talks to ensure that their diplomatic asylum will be respected. we have talked with the ambassadors from the countries of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement. i have personally spoken with the ambassadors of

(reporter) what is your personal opinion of the incident? (larco cox) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe. according to panamanian reports, charge d'affaires luis sandiga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government. the truth is that sandiga has not made any declarations. however, former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government. he could not think of anything better than to point at sandiga as the person responsible for alleged statements. sandiga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job. besides, his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy's military attaches have been stolen; there is no way to begin an investigation. (reporter) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation? (larco cox) you can make your own conclusions. (reporter) if the situation deteriorates, will peru recall all of its personnel from panama? (larco cox) we can not go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause, as we said in the communique. our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of asylum is respected. as long as the refugees remain in the embassy, we will maintain our representation at the level of first secretary.

critical moment for the salvadoran president, and he knows it. but this point was also stressed by the large numbers of people who booed him at nearly every large u.s. city he visited. although the ghosts of the assassinated jesuits shadowed him all during his tour, the arena (nationalist republican alliance) representative, just as his predecessor jose napoleon duarte did, flew to the united states to try to convince the legislators, particularly the democrats, that he intends to resume the dialogue for peace and check the army's criminal aspirations. waving the human rights flag has been the most important thing for cristiani, particularly because he is aware that with this action he can continue to receive washington's financial support for his government. according to to some experts, cristiani went farther than his predecessor. he asked the un secretary general to help in the resumption of talks with the guerrillas, replaced several military officers of doubtful reputation, and assured he will punish severely eight soldiers accused of assassinating the six jesuit priests. we must keep in mind that, prior to his trip, the salvadoran president succeeded in curbing a coup attempt staged by army reactionary groups. members of the salvadoran opposition have coincided in ther view that never before had a head of state challenged the military hierarchy to such an extent, a hierarchy that opposes all negotiation with the guerrillas. the experts also said, however, that the country's internal situation has never been so serious. the rebel offensive launched in november is a landmark, after which everything will be different in el salvador, beginning with the government party, which was left in a very delicate situation in the eyes of influential u.s. power circles. the guerrilla drive also demonstrated that only two alternatives are left for the country. if serious peace negotiations are not initiated, the counterinsurgency policy will be aggravated. this could even give the united states a pretext to intervene directly in the country. although president george bush said he would continue to aid el salvador, a large number of legislators for a long time have been questioning what use has been nearly$ 4 billion delivered to the salvadoran army in 10 years of war. if for the white house the alternative is to continue to give military aid to el salvador or resign itself to an eventual victory of the rebels, for cristiani the situation is even more difficult because, to get more money, he must ensure that human rights are respected. this is equivalent to influencing the most reactionary military officers and guaranteeing the fulfillment of the famous economic recovery plan advocated by his party. these points are nearly impossible to comply with in a country immersed in war. if the economy is weak, respect for human rights is even weaker. anyway, the u.s. government is planning to increase aid for the

expressed regret over the deaths of the soldiers in segovia, antioquia department, said that this type of incident is normal within the framework of the war that the government is waging against armed subversion. last night, president virgilio barco vargas, after the closing ceremony of the 25th agrarian congress of the (fac) (expansion unknown), said that the guerrillas are desperate and this is reflected in their actions. nevertheless, the armed forces will continue to fight subversion anywhere in the country, he added. the president expressed his satisfaction at the release of santander

(cristiani) as i have said before, statements by ortega and other representatives of the sandinist front are a source of concern. they could indicate that the elections may have been very free and honest, but also a farce as far as improving the democratic process is concerned. the nicaraguan people would be denied the right to freely pick their rulers and the right of these rulers to act as they deem best. i would say that the nicaraguan revolution belongs not just to the fsln. the fsln was one of the participants in the revolution in nicaragua against anastasio somoza. the fact is that a consensus existed among all sectors that supported that revolution. the fsln has no monopoly on or exclusive control over that revolution. i believe that in ideological terms there are differences between the views of ms. chamorro and uno (national opposition union), that is, the new government-elect, and the views of the fsln. yet, the people picked the government. it is worrisome to hear some statements that the fsln will rule from below. we believe they would seek to do that by keeping control over the army. let me repeat: there is nothing democratic about a political party controlling the army. the army must respond to the government and the country's democratic process, and not to just one political party. we believe things have not been settled yet. we believe that there are still many things left pending.

monstrous crime that has cut short the life of a man who had shown his will for peace and his commitment to colombia. the crime was directed at hindering the development of the electoral process and destroying the reconciliation process that the government and m-19 (19 april movement) carefully constructed, surpassing many obstacles. in this case, as in many others, this painful tragedy should serve to consolidate the ideals of peace and pluralism for which so many colombians have struggled--one of them, carlos pizarro. it should serve to reassert our repudiation of violence and our faith in democratic procedures. further on the president's message notes: pizarro's relatives and his followers know that the government, and i personally, feel strong wrath and sadness, but we will not be discouraged. we will uphold the banners of reconciliation, pluralism, and the right to freely and peacefully express any idea. we will also continue to unmask and combat enemies of peace. the president adds in his message: i interpret the desire of all colombians who admired carlos pizarro's democratic vocation, by warning those who are responsible for this tragic murder that they will not manage to destroy what has been worked for so hard and with the support of political forces and the people who voted for peace on 11 march to open a road for peace that is clear, possible, and defined. the president's message continues: you know that during this peace process, many enemies and difficulties were surpassed, but none has been so large as this tragedy that has shaken all colombians. the obligation that lies before us is to keep open the road to peace that the murderers of carlos pizarro want to destroy. article 95 of the electoral code indicates that when a presidential candidate dies, another person in his own movement has the right to take his place. in compliance with this norm, the government will offer every facility for the registry of a new m-19 presidential candidate, so that he can continue to hoist the flags of peace and pluralism as is proper for a democratic debate. the president also says in his message: i have asked the government minister and the peace adviser to meet as soon as possible with m-19 representatives so that together they may study alternatives to confront such a serious situation. as soon as possible, the government minister will also direct contacts with the rest of the political forces to request their opinions about the present situation and to continue to give all the necessary guarantees so that the electoral process may develop according to what is established in the constitution and our laws. the message ends: i invite all colombians who are tired of so much violence to come to the polls in the next elections and vote for peace and pluralism. i invite all political and social forces to join in solidarity with the electoral process and defend the institutions that are threatened by violence. it is time for good sense and prudence. it is time to rise to the occasion and show our commitment to democracy. this is the text of president virgilio barco's message on the murder mr.

his companion's bodyguards? the two men were probably returning from a corruption center, a night club--one of those exclusive clubs where the u.s. advisers and other u.s. and salvadoran government officials spend the dollars they steal from the funds allotted to el salvador and where they plan crimes against the people. much more could be said; however, the truth is that the incident was no mere accident. mrs platero is another victim of the madness affecting an army directed by u.s. advisers. there is not much difference between this incident and the hurling of a grenade by a soldier driven crazy by the psychological terrorism practiced by the army advisers and chiefs. there is no doubt in our minds that golcher will not be tried for this new crime, just as he has not been tried for the many crimes he has been responsible for as chief of the repressive corps and death squads.", "pred_templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [],

to convince foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with noriega, such as the fmln and the m-19, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; and to move the anti-noriega sector within the fdp to support specific actions against noriega's regime. the fdp members, officers, and troops were the targets of this plan. we see how some were taken in by the psychological operations plan. the targets of this plan were gen noriega, noriega's panamanian collaborators within the fdp, some civilians, foreign governments that are noriega's allies, foreign governments that are hostile to noriega, and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with noriega. they identified all of noriega's vulnerabilities, as well as the vulnerabilities of all the targets we have already mentioned. there were certain themes used in these psychological operations, and the media fell for them many times. this is why we repeatedly asked them not to fall for this misinformation. these themes included: by imposing his arbitrary nature and corruption, noriega is perverting the fdp and promoting the disintegration of that military institution. the fdp have become a mafia that is heading toward disgrace. this is a topic that has been discussed in leaflets and many publications. by disrupting the constitutional order at his whim, noriega is provoking a profound social, economic, and political crisis that is ruining the country. this is done to hide those who are truly responsible for the crisis we are experiencing. the longer noriega remains in power, the more probable becomes a u.s., cuban, or soviet intervention. the domestic and international conflicts provoked by noriega negatively affect the personal well-being of the fdp members and their families. noriega's fall is inevitable and the fdp should not fall with him. to save the fdp and the republic of panama, the fdp must remove noriega from office. this is why there were siren songs that an internal coup was under way. the state security organizations have been following this case for 5 months and we know the fugitives are in the united states. we know where they left from. no one can deny the association of certain u.s. citizens who are involved in this operation with the panamanian groups that were captured. we have the evidence, the weapons, the instruments used for misinformation, the plans, and the maps with the targets for violence. important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked on these maps. they had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed. gentlemen, we know the power of weapons and we know how to use them. we know the damage they can do. therefore, before there was a violent confrontation between the panamanian people and their fdp, we went one step ahead of their plans. if arrests were made, it was because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those who received, with a siren song, the promise of the panamanian people's$ 30 million that eric arturo delvalle was going to use for subversive acts, bloody acts to bathe our people in blood, as in the case of the struggle of our brother countries in latin and central america. we will not permit that. that is why we decided to go one step ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would result in mourning and pain for panamanian families. we have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well arrested: alberto conte, fred boyd, and all those people who have been working behind the scenes so eduardo herrera and friends can live like kings in the united statets, so they can live their lives drinking champagne and eating pheasant. eduardo herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling 40 boxes of whiskey per week into israel. he is the kind of person protected by the pentagon and elliott abrams. he is elliott abrams' hero. theresa wellington of the (u.s.) embassy in mexico, who gave these people--who left panama for mexico--their visas in 10 minutes by abrams' orders, has also become one of our people's enemies.

(vides) we can not conceive their military superiority under any circumstances. i have noticed the guerrilla leaders are currently visiting different countries, particularly the contadora group members. they are trying to gain support for reading a statement at the oas meeting, and they are also trying to pressure the salvadoran government into negotiating with them. this proves the rebels have failed militarily, and that failure has been brought about by our large-scale operations in northern chalatenango department and usulutan department, in the east of the country. the rebels have tried to bring the war to urban areas. however, the plans of subversive groups--i showed you the documents on their fire plan in another meeting--did not include the type of terrorist acts that we have seen lately. instead, they planned a general uprising and strike before the elections. this proves, as i said, that the subversives could not develop their fire plan. they have carried out several acts but they have failed to achieve the expected results. this is like having a cinema show a movie every day with no-one turning up to see it. the subversives are trying to carry out this type of event right now to give the impression of military strength, so the oas will pass a resolution recommending negotiation to solve the conflict. furthermore, the rebels are trying to discredit the democratic process and boycott our next elections because some people are demoralized by terrorism and lack the will to participate in politics, which makes the election results unsatisfactory.

put it more clearly, the presumption is that they will wait until things are under way before trying to put their own mark on the newborn. christian left (ic) was the first to give this signal. the resolutions of its plenum, made public on 28 october, clearly revealed that it intended to unify the entire left in the formation of the new political entity. in passing, they sent a message to their men who were involved in the ppd (party for democracy): they have to decide between membership in one or the other, but not both. this is something that mapu (united popular action movement) -barrueto is not addressing with the same earnestness. they apparently seek to take part in every group there is, whether it is called the ppd, cosono (socialist command for the no) or leftist party. the christian left people went even further. at no time did they conceal their wish that luis maira preside over the new party. the plenum of the socialist party (ps) -almeyda was, of course, the most eagerly anticipated. as on other occasions, it was supposed to set the tone for the jockeying by the left. they ambitiously felt that this was the opportunity to remove some strategic obstacles, sort of like killing two birds with one stone: registration and the sought-after socialist unity. perhaps this is why they held their plenum, where on 28 and 29 october they discussed the advantages of registering their own party, in other words, responding once and for all to the initiatives of the nunezes, who took over the ppd, the only legally recognized socialist group. others thought that it would be wiser to promote a party in the \"socialist space,\" bring together there christian left, mapu-barrueto and the small socialist groups that still exist, in other words, cosono as a party. this stand obviously gave priority to something of a leading political role and kept the pc at a distance. the option of registering a broad left-wing group was also raised at the plenum; to many this entailed a certain \"sacrifice\" of predominance by the socialists. the ps-almeyda ultimately opted for a \"consensus\" vote, of whose public version there were several interpretations. there was talk of\"the registration of a legal instrument representative of the socialist space at the disposal of the grassroots forces and of the progressive and leftist independents who have so far belonged to unlegalized parties.\" the intention of the socialist language was clear, but the party did not close ranks with a broad left-wing alliance. the emphasis was in the eye of the beholder. what was not
